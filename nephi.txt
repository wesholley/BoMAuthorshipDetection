THE FIRST BOOK OF NEPHI
HIS REIGN AND MINISTRY
An account of Lehi and his wife Sariah, and his four sons, being called, (beginning at the eldest) Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi.
The Lord warns Lehi to depart out of the land of Jerusalem, because he prophesieth unto the people concerning their iniquity and they
seek to destroy his life. He taketh three days? journey into the wilderness with his family. Nephi taketh his brethren and returneth to
the land of Jerusalem after the record of the Jews. The account of their sufferings. They take the daughters of Ishmael to wife. They
take their families and depart into the wilderness. Their sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness. The course of their travels. They
come to the large waters. Nephi's brethren rebel against him. He confoundeth them, and buildeth a ship. They call the name of the
place Bountiful. They cross the large waters into the promised land, and so forth. This is according to the account of Nephi; or in other
words, I, Nephi, wrote this record.





I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen
many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great
knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.
Yea, I make a record in the language of my father, which consists of the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians.
And I know that the record which I make is true; and I make it with mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.
For it came to pass in the commencement of the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, (my father, Lehi, having dwelt at
Jerusalem in all his days); and in that same year there came many prophets, prophesying unto the people that they must repent, or the
great city Jerusalem must be destroyed.
Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his
people.
And it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard
much; and because of the things which he saw and heard he did quake and tremble exceedingly.
And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with the
Spirit and the things which he had seen.
And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away in a vision, even that he saw the heavens open, and he thought he
saw God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels in the attitude of singing and praising their God.
And it came to pass that he saw One descending out of the midst of heaven, and he beheld that his luster was above that of the sun
at noon-day.
And he also saw twelve others following him, and their brightness did exceed that of the stars in the firmament.
And they came down and went forth upon the face of the earth; and the first came and stood before my father, and gave unto him
a book, and bade him that he should read.
And it came to pass that as he read, he was filled with the Spirit of the Lord.
And he read, saying:


Yea, and many things did my father read concerning Jerusalem--that it should be destroyed, and the inhabitants thereof; many should
perish by the sword, and many should be carried away captive into Babylon.
And it came to pass that when my father had read and seen many great and marvelous things, he did exclaim many things unto the
Lord; such as:


And after this manner was the language of my father in the praising of his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole heart was
filled, because of the things which he had seen, yea, which the Lord had shown unto him.
And now I, Nephi, do not make a full account of the things which my father hath written, for he hath written many things which
he saw in visions and in dreams; and he also hath written many things which he prophesied and spake unto his children, of which I
shall not make a full account.
But I shall make an account of my proceedings in my days. Behold, I make an abridgment of the record of my father, upon plates
which I have made with mine own hands; wherefore, after I have abridged the record of my father then will I make an account of mine
own life.
Therefore, I would that ye should know, that after the Lord had shown so many marvelous things unto my father, Lehi, yea,
concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, behold he went forth among the people, and began to prophesy and to declare unto them
concerning the things which he had both seen and heard.
And it came to pass that the Jews did mock him because of the things which he testified of them; for he truly testified of their
wickedness and their abominations; and he testified that the things which he saw and heard, and also the things which he read in the
book, manifested plainly of the coming of a Messiah, and also the redemption of the world.
And when the Jews heard these things they were angry with him; yea, even as with the prophets of old, whom they had cast out,
and stoned, and slain; and they also sought his life, that they might take it away. But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the
tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power
of deliverance.


For behold, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and said unto him:


And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my father, even in a dream, that he should take his family and depart into the
wilderness.
And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him.
And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his
silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and departed into the
wilderness.
And he came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea; and he traveled in the wilderness in the borders which are nearer
the Red Sea; and he did travel in the wilderness with his family, which consisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder brothers, who
were Laman, Lemuel, and Sam.
And it came to pass that when he had traveled three days in the wilderness, he pitched his tent in a valley by the side of a river of
water.
And it came to pass that he built an altar of stones, and made an offering unto the Lord, and gave thanks unto the Lord our God.
And it came to pass that he called the name of the river, Laman, and it emptied into the Red Sea; and the valley was in the borders
near the mouth thereof.
And when my father saw that the waters of the river emptied into the fountain of the Red Sea, he spake unto Laman, saying:


And he also spake unto Lemuel:


Now this he spake because of the stiffneckedness of Laman and Lemuel; for behold they did murmur in many things against their
father, because he was a visionary man, and had led them out of the land of Jerusalem, to leave the land of their inheritance, and their
gold, and their silver, and their precious things, to perish in the wilderness. And this they said he had done because of the foolish
imaginations of his heart.
And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did murmur against their father. And they did murmur because they knew not the
dealings of that God who had created them.
Neither did they believe that Jerusalem, that great city, could be destroyed according to the words of the prophets. And they were
like unto the Jews who were at Jerusalem, who sought to take away the life of my father.
And it came to pass that my father did speak unto them in the valley of Lemuel, with power, being filled with the Spirit, until their
frames did shake before him. And he did confound them, that they durst not utter against him; wherefore, they did as he commanded
them.
And my father dwelt in a tent.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great desires to
know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did
believe all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers.
And I spake unto Sam, making known unto him the things which the Lord had manifested unto me by his Holy Spirit. And it
came to pass that he believed in my words.
But, behold, Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto my words; and being grieved because of the hardness of their hearts I
cried unto the Lord for them.
And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying:


And it came to pass that I, Nephi, returned from speaking with the Lord, to the tent of my father.
And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying:


And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that
the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing
which he commandeth them.
And it came to pass that when my father had heard these words he was exceedingly glad, for he knew that I had been blessed of the
Lord.
And I, Nephi, and my brethren took our journey in the wilderness, with our tents, to go up to the land of Jerusalem.
And it came to pass that when we had gone up to the land of Jerusalem, I and my brethren did consult one with another.
And we cast lots--who of us should go in unto the house of Laban. And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman; and Laman
went in unto the house of Laban, and he talked with him as he sat in his house.
And he desired of Laban the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, which contained the genealogy of my father.
And behold, it came to pass that Laban was angry, and thrust him out from his presence; and he would not that he should have the
records. Wherefore, he said unto him:


But Laman fled out of his presence, and told the things which Laban had done, unto us. And we began to be exceedingly
sorrowful, and my brethren were about to return unto my father in the wilderness.
But behold I said unto them that: As the Lord liveth, and as we live, we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness until
we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us.
Wherefore, let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; therefore let us go down to the land of our father's
inheritance, for behold he left gold and silver, and all manner of riches. And all this he hath done because of the commandments of the
Lord.
For he knew that Jerusalem must be destroyed, because of the wickedness of the people.
For behold, they have rejected the words of the prophets. Wherefore, if my father should dwell in the land after he hath been
commanded to flee out of the land, behold, he would also perish. Wherefore, it must needs be that he flee out of the land.
And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these records, that we may preserve unto our children the language of our
fathers;
And also that we may preserve unto them the words which have been spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets, which have
been delivered unto them by the Spirit and power of God, since the world began, even down unto this present time.
And it came to pass that after this manner of language did I persuade my brethren, that they might be faithful in keeping the
commandments of God.
And it came to pass that we went down to the land of our inheritance, and we did gather together our gold, and our silver, and our
precious things.
And after we had gathered these things together, we went up again unto the house of Laban.
And it came to pass that we went in unto Laban, and desired him that he would give unto us the records which were engraven
upon the plates of brass, for which we would give unto him our gold, and our silver, and all our precious things.
And it came to pass that when Laban saw our property, and that it was exceedingly great, he did lust after it, insomuch that he
thrust us out, and sent his servants to slay us, that he might obtain our property.
And it came to pass that we did flee before the servants of Laban, and we were obliged to leave behind our property, and it fell
into the hands of Laban.
And it came to pass that we fled into the wilderness, and the servants of Laban did not overtake us, and we hid ourselves in the
cavity of a rock.
And it came to pass that Laman was angry with me, and also with my father; and also was Lemuel, for he hearkened unto the
words of Laman. Wherefore Laman and Lemuel did speak many hard words unto us, their younger brothers, and they did smite us
even with a rod.
And it came to pass as they smote us with a rod, behold, an angel of the Lord came and stood before them, and he spake unto
them, saying:


And after the angel had spoken unto us, he departed.
And after the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again began to murmur, saying:


And it came to pass that I spake unto my brethren, saying: Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be faithful in keeping the
commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty, yea, or even
than his tens of thousands?
Therefore let us go up; let us be strong like unto Moses; for he truly spake unto the waters of the Red Sea and they divided hither
and thither, and our fathers came through, out of captivity, on dry ground, and the armies of Pharaoh did follow and were drowned in
the waters of the Red Sea.
Now behold ye know that this is true; and ye also know that an angel hath spoken unto you; wherefore can ye doubt? Let us go up;
the Lord is able to deliver us, even as our fathers, and to destroy Laban, even as the Egyptians.
Now when I had spoken these words, they were yet wroth, and did still continue to murmur; nevertheless they did follow me up
until we came without the walls of Jerusalem.
And it was by night; and I caused that they should hide themselves without the walls. And after they had hid themselves, I, Nephi,
crept into the city and went forth towards the house of Laban.
And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do.
Nevertheless I went forth, and as I came near unto the house of Laban I beheld a man, and he had fallen to the earth before me, for
he was drunken with wine.
And when I came to him I found that it was Laban.
And I beheld his sword, and I drew it forth from the sheath thereof; and the hilt thereof was of pure gold, and the workmanship
thereof was exceedingly fine, and I saw that the blade thereof was of the most precious steel.
And it came to pass that I was constrained by the Spirit that I should kill Laban; but I said in my heart: Never at any time have I
shed the blood of man. And I shrunk and would that I might not slay him.
And the Spirit said unto me again:


Yea, and I also knew that he had sought to take away mine own life; yea, and he would not hearken unto the commandments of the
Lord; and he also had taken away our property.
And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me again:


And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words, I remembered the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness,
saying that:


Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the commandments of the Lord according to the law of Moses, save they should
have the law.
And I also knew that the law was engraven upon the plates of brass.
And again, I knew that the Lord had delivered Laban into my hands for this cause--that I might obtain the records according to
his commandments.
Therefore I did obey the voice of the Spirit, and took Laban by the hair of the head, and I smote off his head with his own sword.
And after I had smitten off his head with his own sword, I took the garments of Laban and put them upon mine own body; yea,
even every whit; and I did gird on his armor about my loins.
And after I had done this, I went forth unto the treasury of Laban. And as I went forth towards the treasury of Laban, behold, I
saw the servant of Laban who had the keys of the treasury. And I commanded him in the voice of Laban, that he should go with me
into the treasury.
And he supposed me to be his master, Laban, for he beheld the garments and also the sword girded about my loins.
And he spake unto me concerning the elders of the Jews, he knowing that his master, Laban, had been out by night among them.
And I spake unto him as if it had been Laban.
And I also spake unto him that I should carry the engravings, which were upon the plates of brass, to my elder brethren, who were
without the walls.
And I also bade him that he should follow me.
And he, supposing that I spake of the brethren of the church, and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he did
follow me.
And he spake unto me many times concerning the elders of the Jews, as I went forth unto my brethren, who were without the
walls.
And it came to pass that when Laman saw me he was exceedingly frightened, and also Lemuel and Sam. And they fled from
before my presence; for they supposed it was Laban, and that he had slain me and had sought to take away their lives also.
And it came to pass that I called after them, and they did hear me; wherefore they did cease to flee from my presence.
And it came to pass that when the servant of Laban beheld my brethren he began to tremble, and was about to flee from before me
and return to the city of Jerusalem.
And now I, Nephi, being a man large in stature, and also having received much strength of the Lord, therefore I did seize upon the
servant of Laban, and held him, that he should not flee.
And it came to pass that I spake with him, that if he would hearken unto my words, as the Lord liveth, and as I live, even so that if
he would hearken unto our words, we would spare his life.
And I spake unto him, even with an oath, that he need not fear; that he should be a free man like unto us if he would go down in
the wilderness with us.
And I also spake unto him, saying: Surely the Lord hath commanded us to do this thing; and shall we not be diligent in keeping
the commandments of the Lord? Therefore, if thou wilt go down into the wilderness to my father thou shalt have place with us.
And it came to pass that Zoram did take courage at the words which I spake. Now Zoram was the name of the servant; and he
promised that he would go down into the wilderness unto our father. Yea, and he also made an oath unto us that he would tarry with us
from that time forth.
Now we were desirous that he should tarry with us for this cause, that the Jews might not know concerning our flight into the
wilderness, lest they should pursue us and destroy us.
And it came to pass that when Zoram had made an oath unto us, our fears did cease concerning him.
And it came to pass that we took the plates of brass and the servant of Laban, and departed into the wilderness, and journeyed
unto the tent of our father.


And it came to pass that after we had come down into the wilderness unto our father, behold, he was filled with joy, and also my
mother, Sariah, was exceedingly glad, for she truly had mourned because of us.
For she had supposed that we had perished in the wilderness; and she also had complained against my father, telling him that he
was a visionary man; saying:


And after this manner of language had my mother complained against my father.
And it had come to pass that my father spake unto her, saying:


And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, comfort my mother, Sariah, concerning us, while we journeyed in the
wilderness up to the land of Jerusalem, to obtain the record of the Jews.
And when we had returned to the tent of my father, behold their joy was full, and my mother was comforted.
And she spake, saying:


And after this manner of language did she speak.
And it came to pass that they did rejoice exceedingly, and did offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto the Lord; and they gave
thanks unto the God of Israel.
And after they had given thanks unto the God of Israel, my father, Lehi, took the records which were engraven upon the plates of
brass, and he did search them from the beginning.
And he beheld that they did contain the five books of Moses, which gave an account of the creation of the world, and also of
Adam and Eve, who were our first parents;
And also a record of the Jews from the beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah;
And also the prophecies of the holy prophets, from the beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah; and
also many prophecies which have been spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah.
And it came to pass that my father, Lehi, also found upon the plates of brass a genealogy of his fathers; wherefore he knew that he
was a descendant of Joseph; yea, even that Joseph who was the son of Jacob, who was sold into Egypt, and who was preserved by the
hand of the Lord, that he might preserve his father, Jacob, and all his household from perishing with famine.
And they were also led out of captivity and out of the land of Egypt, by that same God who had preserved them.
And thus my father, Lehi, did discover the genealogy of his fathers. And Laban also was a descendant of Joseph, wherefore he
and his fathers had kept the records.
And now when my father saw all these things, he was filled with the Spirit, and began to prophesy concerning his seed?
That these plates of brass should go forth unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people who were of his seed.
Wherefore, he said that these plates of brass should never perish; neither should they be dimmed any more by time. And he
prophesied many things concerning his seed.
And it came to pass that thus far I and my father had kept the commandments wherewith the Lord had commanded us.
And we had obtained the records which the Lord had commanded us, and searched them and found that they were desirable; yea,
even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children.
Wherefore, it was wisdom in the Lord that we should carry them with us, as we journeyed in the wilderness towards the land of
promise.


And now I, Nephi, do not give the genealogy of my fathers in this part of my record; neither at any time shall I give it after upon
these plates which I am writing; for it is given in the record which has been kept by my father; wherefore, I do not write it in this
work.
For it sufficeth me to say that we are descendants of Joseph.
And it mattereth not to me that I am particular to give a full account of all the things of my father, for they cannot be written upon
these plates, for I desire the room that I may write of the things of God.
For the fulness of mine intent is that I may persuade men to come unto the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob, and be saved.
Wherefore, the things which are pleasing unto the world I do not write, but the things which are pleasing unto God and unto those
who are not of the world.
Wherefore, I shall give commandment unto my seed, that they shall not occupy these plates with things which are not of worth
unto the children of men.


And now I would that ye might know, that after my father, Lehi, had made an end of prophesying concerning his seed, it came to
pass that the Lord spake unto him again, saying that it was not meet for him, Lehi, that he should take his family into the wilderness
alone; but that his sons should take daughters to wife, that they might raise up seed unto the Lord in the land of promise.
And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that I, Nephi, and my brethren, should again return unto the land of Jerusalem,
and bring down Ishmael and his family into the wilderness.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did again, with my brethren, go forth into the wilderness to go up to Jerusalem.
And it came to pass that we went up unto the house of Ishmael, and we did gain favor in the sight of Ishmael, insomuch that we did
speak unto him the words of the Lord.
And it came to pass that the Lord did soften the heart of Ishmael, and also his household, insomuch that they took their journey
with us down into the wilderness to the tent of our father.
And it came to pass that as we journeyed in the wilderness, behold Laman and Lemuel, and two of the daughters of Ishmael, and
the two sons of Ishmael and their families, did rebel against us; yea, against me, Nephi, and Sam, and their father, Ishmael, and his
wife, and his three other daughters.
And it came to pass in the which rebellion, they were desirous to return unto the land of Jerusalem.
And now I, Nephi, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, therefore I spake unto them, saying, yea, even unto Laman and
unto Lemuel: Behold ye are mine elder brethren, and how is it that ye are so hard in your hearts, and so blind in your minds, that ye
have need that I, your younger brother, should speak unto you, yea, and set an example for you?
How is it that ye have not hearkened unto the word of the Lord?
How is it that ye have forgotten that ye have seen an angel of the Lord?
Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten what great things the Lord hath done for us, in delivering us out of the hands of Laban,
and also that we should obtain the record?
Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten that the Lord is able to do all things according to his will, for the children of men, if it so
be that they exercise faith in him? Wherefore, let us be faithful to him.
And if it so be that we are faithful to him, we shall obtain the land of promise; and ye shall know at some future period that the
word of the Lord shall be fulfilled concerning the destruction of Jerusalem; for all things which the Lord hath spoken concerning the
destruction of Jerusalem must be fulfilled.
For behold, the Spirit of the Lord ceaseth soon to strive with them; for behold, they have rejected the prophets, and Jeremiah have
they cast into prison. And they have sought to take away the life of my father, insomuch that they have driven him out of the land.
Now behold, I say unto you that if ye will return unto Jerusalem ye shall also perish with them. And now, if ye have choice, go up
to the land, and remember the words which I speak unto you, that if ye go ye will also perish; for thus the Spirit of the Lord
constraineth me that I should speak.
And it came to pass that when I, Nephi, had spoken these words unto my brethren, they were angry with me. And it came to pass
that they did lay their hands upon me, for behold, they were exceedingly wroth, and they did bind me with cords, for they sought to
take away my life, that they might leave me in the wilderness to be devoured by wild beasts.
But it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, according to my faith which is in thee, wilt thou deliver me from
the hands of my brethren; yea, even give me strength that I may burst these bands with which I am bound.
And it came to pass that when I had said these words, behold, the bands were loosed from off my hands and feet, and I stood
before my brethren, and I spake unto them again.
And it came to pass that they were angry with me again, and sought to lay hands upon me; but behold, one of the daughters of
Ishmael, yea, and also her mother, and one of the sons of Ishmael, did plead with my brethren, insomuch that they did soften their
hearts; and they did cease striving to take away my life.
And it came to pass that they were sorrowful, because of their wickedness, insomuch that they did bow down before me, and did
plead with me that I would forgive them of the thing that they had done against me.
And it came to pass that I did frankly forgive them all that they had done, and I did exhort them that they would pray unto the
Lord their God for forgiveness. And it came to pass that they did so. And after they had done praying unto the Lord we did again
travel on our journey towards the tent of our father.
And it came to pass that we did come down unto the tent of our father. And after I and my brethren and all the house of Ishmael
had come down unto the tent of my father, they did give thanks unto the Lord their God; and they did offer sacrifice and burnt
offerings unto him.


And it came to pass that we had gathered together all manner of seeds of every kind, both of grain of every kind, and also of the
seeds of fruit of every kind.
And it came to pass that while my father tarried in the wilderness he spake unto us, saying:


And now I, Nephi, do not speak all the words of my father.
But, to be short in writing, behold, he saw other multitudes pressing forward; and they came and caught hold of the end of the rod
of iron; and they did press their way forward, continually holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell down and
partook of the fruit of the tree.
And he also saw other multitudes feeling their way towards that great and spacious building.
And it came to pass that many were drowned in the depths of the fountain; and many were lost from his view, wandering in
strange roads.
And great was the multitude that did enter into that strange building. And after they did enter into that building they did point the
finger of scorn at me and those that were partaking of the fruit also; but we heeded them not.
These are the words of my father:


said my father.
And it came to pass after my father had spoken all the words of his dream or vision, which were many, he said unto us, because of
these things which he saw in a vision, he exceedingly feared for Laman and Lemuel; yea, he feared lest they should be cast off from
the presence of the Lord.
And he did exhort them then with all the feeling of a tender parent, that they would hearken to his words, that perhaps the Lord
would be merciful to them, and not cast them off; yea, my father did preach unto them.
And after he had preached unto them, and also prophesied unto them of many things, he bade them to keep the commandments of
the Lord; and he did cease speaking unto them.


And all these things did my father see, and hear, and speak, as he dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel, and also a great many
more things, which cannot be written upon these plates.
And now, as I have spoken concerning these plates, behold they are not the plates upon which I make a full account of the history
of my people; for the plates upon which I make a full account of my people I have given the name of Nephi; wherefore, they are called
the plates of Nephi, after mine own name; and these plates also are called the plates of Nephi.
Nevertheless, I have received a commandment of the Lord that I should make these plates, for the special purpose that there should
be an account engraven of the ministry of my people.
Upon the other plates should be engraven an account of the reign of the kings, and the wars and contentions of my people;
wherefore these plates are for the more part of the ministry; and the other plates are for the more part of the reign of the kings and the
wars and contentions of my people.
Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me to make these plates for a wise purpose in him, which purpose I know not.
But the Lord knoweth all things from the beginning; wherefore, he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children
of men; for behold, he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his words. And thus it is. Amen.


And now I, Nephi, proceed to give an account upon these plates of my proceedings, and my reign and ministry; wherefore, to
proceed with mine account, I must speak somewhat of the things of my father, and also of my brethren.
For behold, it came to pass after my father had made an end of speaking the words of his dream, and also of exhorting them to all
diligence, he spake unto them concerning the Jews?
That after they should be destroyed, even that great city Jerusalem, and many be carried away captive into Babylon, according to
the own due time of the Lord, they should return again, yea, even be brought back out of captivity; and after they should be brought
back out of captivity they should possess again the land of their inheritance.
Yea, even six hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem, a prophet would the Lord God raise up among the Jews?
even a Messiah, or, in other words, a Savior of the world.
And he also spake concerning the prophets, how great a number had testified of these things, concerning this Messiah, of whom he
had spoken, or this Redeemer of the world.
Wherefore, all mankind were in a lost and in a fallen state, and ever would be save they should rely on this Redeemer.
And he spake also concerning a prophet who should come before the Messiah, to prepare the way of the Lord?
Yea, even he should go forth and cry in the wilderness:


And much spake my father concerning this thing.
And my father said he should baptize in Bethabara, beyond Jordan; and he also said he should baptize with water; even that he
should baptize the Messiah with water.
And after he had baptized the Messiah with water, he should behold and bear record that he had baptized the Lamb of God, who
should take away the sins of the world.
And it came to pass after my father had spoken these words he spake unto my brethren concerning the gospel which should be
preached among the Jews, and also concerning the dwindling of the Jews in unbelief. And after they had slain the Messiah, who
should come, and after he had been slain he should rise from the dead, and should make himself manifest, by the Holy Ghost, unto the
Gentiles.
Yea, even my father spake much concerning the Gentiles, and also concerning the house of Israel, that they should be compared
like unto an olive tree, whose branches should be broken off and should be scattered upon all the face of the earth.
Wherefore, he said it must needs be that we should be led with one accord into the land of promise, unto the fulfilling of the word
of the Lord, that we should be scattered upon all the face of the earth.
And after the house of Israel should be scattered they should be gathered together again; or, in fine, after the Gentiles had received
the fulness of the Gospel, the natural branches of the olive tree, or the remnants of the house of Israel, should be grafted in, or come to
the knowledge of the true Messiah, their Lord and their Redeemer.
And after this manner of language did my father prophesy and speak unto my brethren, and also many more things which I do not
write in this book; for I have written as many of them as were expedient for me in mine other book.
And all these things, of which I have spoken, were done as my father dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel.
And it came to pass after I, Nephi, having heard all the words of my father, concerning the things which he saw in a vision, and
also the things which he spake by the power of the Holy Ghost, which power he received by faith on the Son of God--and the Son of
God was the Messiah who should come--I, Nephi, was desirous also that I might see, and hear, and know of these things, by the
power of the Holy Ghost, which is the gift of God unto all those who diligently seek him, as well in times of old as in the time that he
should manifest himself unto the children of men.
For he is the same yesterday, today, and forever; and the way is prepared for all men from the foundation of the world, if it so be
that they repent and come unto him.
For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as
well in these times as in times of old, and as well in times of old as in times to come; wherefore, the course of the Lord is one eternal
round.
Therefore remember, O man, for all thy doings thou shalt be brought into judgment.
Wherefore, if ye have sought to do wickedly in the days of your probation, then ye are found unclean before the judgment-seat of
God; and no unclean thing can dwell with God; wherefore, ye must be cast off forever.
And the Holy Ghost giveth authority that I should speak these things, and deny them not.


For it came to pass after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make
them known unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart I was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly high
mountain, which I never had before seen, and upon which I never had before set my foot.
And the Spirit said unto me:


And I said: I desire to behold the things which my father saw.
And the Spirit said unto me:


And I said: Yea, thou knowest that I believe all the words of my father.
And when I had spoken these words, the Spirit cried with a loud voice, saying:


And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me:


And I looked and beheld a tree; and it was like unto the tree which my father had seen; and the beauty thereof was far beyond, yea,
exceeding of all beauty; and the whiteness thereof did exceed the whiteness of the driven snow.
And it came to pass after I had seen the tree, I said unto the Spirit: I behold thou hast shown unto me the tree which is precious
above all.
And he said unto me:


And I said unto him: To know the interpretation thereof--for I spake unto him as a man speaketh; for I beheld that he was in the
form of a man; yet nevertheless, I knew that it was the Spirit of the Lord; and he spake unto me as a man speaketh with another.
And it came to pass that he said unto me:


And I looked as if to look upon him, and I saw him not; for he had gone from before my presence.
And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city of Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I beheld the city of Nazareth;
and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was exceedingly fair and white.
And it came to pass that I saw the heavens open; and an angel came down and stood before me; and he said unto me:


And I said unto him: A virgin, most beautiful and fair above all other virgins.
And he said unto me:


And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.
And he said unto me:


And it came to pass that I beheld that she was carried away in the Spirit; and after she had been carried away in the Spirit for the
space of a time the angel spake unto me, saying:


And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in her arms.
And the angel said unto me:


And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men;
wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things.
And he spake unto me, saying:


And after he had said these words, he said unto me:


And I looked, and I beheld the Son of God going forth among the children of men; and I saw many fall down at his feet and worship
him.
And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which my father had seen, was the word of God, which led to the fountain of
living waters, or to the tree of life; which waters are a representation of the love of God; and I also beheld that the tree of life was a
representation of the love of God.
And the angel said unto me again:


And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world, of whom my father had spoken; and I also beheld the prophet who should
prepare the way before him. And the Lamb of God went forth and was baptized of him; and after he was baptized, I beheld the
heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of heaven and abide upon him in the form of a dove.
And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people, in power and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered together
to hear him; and I beheld that they cast him out from among them.
And I also beheld twelve others following him. And it came to pass that they were carried away in the Spirit from before my face,
and I saw them not.
And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying:


And I looked, and I beheld the heavens open again, and I saw angels descending upon the children of men; and they did minister unto
them.
And he spake unto me again, saying:


And I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of people who were
sick, and who were afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits; and the angel spake and showed all these
things unto me. And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out.
And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying:


And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was judged of the
world; and I saw and bear record.
And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world.
And after he was slain I saw the multitudes of the earth, that they were gathered together to fight against the apostles of the Lamb;
for thus were the twelve called by the angel of the Lord.
And the multitude of the earth was gathered together; and I beheld that they were in a large and spacious building, like unto the
building which my father saw. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying:


And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the great and spacious building was the pride of the world; and it fell, and the
fall thereof was exceedingly great. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying:


And it came to pass that the angel said unto me:


And I looked and beheld the land of promise; and I beheld multitudes of people, yea, even as it were in number as many as the sand of
the sea.
And it came to pass that I beheld multitudes gathered together to battle, one against the other; and I beheld wars, and rumors of
wars, and great slaughters with the sword among my people.
And it came to pass that I beheld many generations pass away, after the manner of wars and contentions in the land; and I beheld
many cities, yea, even that I did not number them.
And it came to pass that I saw a mist of darkness on the face of the land of promise; and I saw lightnings, and I heard thunderings,
and earthquakes, and all manner of tumultuous noises; and I saw the earth and the rocks, that they rent; and I saw mountains tumbling
into pieces; and I saw the plains of the earth, that they were broken up; and I saw many cities that they were sunk; and I saw many that
they were burned with fire; and I saw many that did tumble to the earth, because of the quaking thereof.
And it came to pass after I saw these things, I saw the vapor of darkness, that it passed from off the face of the earth; and behold, I
saw multitudes who had not fallen because of the great and terrible judgments of the Lord.
And I saw the heavens open, and the Lamb of God descending out of heaven; and he came down and showed himself unto them.
And I also saw and bear record that the Holy Ghost fell upon twelve others; and they were ordained of God, and chosen.
And the angel spake unto me, saying:


And he said unto me:


And the angel said unto me:


And I looked, and beheld three generations pass away in righteousness; and their garments were white even like unto the Lamb of
God. And the angel said unto me:


And I, Nephi, also saw many of the fourth generation who passed away in righteousness.
And it came to pass that I saw the multitudes of the earth gathered together.
And the angel said unto me:


And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the people of my seed gathered together in multitudes against the seed of my
brethren; and they were gathered together to battle.
And the angel spake unto me, saying:


And while the angel spake these words, I beheld and saw that the seed of my brethren did contend against my seed, according to
the word of the angel; and because of the pride of my seed, and the temptations of the devil, I beheld that the seed of my brethren did
overpower the people of my seed.
And it came to pass that I beheld, and saw the people of the seed of my brethren that they had overcome my seed; and they went
forth in multitudes upon the face of the land.
And I saw them gathered together in multitudes; and I saw wars and rumors of wars among them; and in wars and rumors of wars
I saw many generations pass away.
And the angel said unto me:


And it came to pass that I beheld, after they had dwindled in unbelief they became a dark, and loathsome, and a filthy people, full
of idleness and all manner of abominations.


And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, saying:


And I looked and beheld many nations and kingdoms.
And the angel said unto me:


And I said: I behold many nations and kingdoms.
And he said unto me:


And it came to pass that I saw among the nations of the Gentiles the formation of a great church.
And the angel said unto me:


And it came to pass that I beheld this great and abominable church; and I saw the devil that he was the founder of it.
And I also saw gold, and silver, and silks, and scarlets, and fine-twined linen, and all manner of precious clothing; and I saw many
harlots.
And the angel spake unto me, saying:


And it came to pass that I looked and beheld many waters; and they divided the Gentiles from the seed of my brethren.
And it came to pass that the angel said unto me:


And I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles, who was separated from the seed of my brethren by the many waters; and I
beheld the Spirit of God, that it came down and wrought upon the man; and he went forth upon the many waters, even unto the seed of
my brethren, who were in the promised land.
And it came to pass that I beheld the Spirit of God, that it wrought upon other Gentiles; and they went forth out of captivity, upon
the many waters.
And it came to pass that I beheld many multitudes of the Gentiles upon the land of promise; and I beheld the wrath of God, that it
was upon the seed of my brethren; and they were scattered before the Gentiles and were smitten.
And I beheld the Spirit of the Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles, and they did prosper and obtain the land for their inheritance;
and I beheld that they were white, and exceedingly fair and beautiful, like unto my people before they were slain.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles who had gone forth out of captivity did humble themselves before the
Lord; and the power of the Lord was with them.
And I beheld that their mother Gentiles were gathered together upon the waters, and upon the land also, to battle against them.
And I beheld that the power of God was with them, and also that the wrath of God was upon all those that were gathered together
against them to battle.
And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of captivity were delivered by the power of God out of the hands of all
other nations.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that they did prosper in the land; and I beheld a book, and it was carried forth among
them.
And the angel said unto me:


And I said unto him: I know not.
And he said:


And I, Nephi, beheld it; and he said unto me:


And the angel of the Lord said unto me:


And it came to pass that the angel of the Lord spake unto me, saying:


And it came to pass that I beheld the remnant of the seed of my brethren, and also the book of the Lamb of God, which had
proceeded forth from the mouth of the Jew, that it came forth from the Gentiles unto the remnant of the seed of my brethren.
And after it had come forth unto them I beheld other books, which came forth by the power of the Lamb, from the Gentiles unto
them, unto the convincing of the Gentiles and the remnant of the seed of my brethren, and also the Jews who were scattered upon all
the face of the earth, that the records of the prophets and of the twelve apostles of the Lamb are true.
And the angel spake unto me, saying:


And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, Nephi, saying:


And it came to pass that when the angel had spoken these words, he said unto me:


I said unto him, Yea.
And it came to pass that he said unto me:


And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the whore of all the earth, and she sat upon many waters; and she had dominion over
all the earth, among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people.
And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and its numbers were few, because of the wickedness and
abominations of the whore who sat upon many waters; nevertheless, I beheld that the church of the Lamb, who were the saints of God,
were also upon all the face of the earth; and their dominions upon the face of the earth were small, because of the wickedness of the
great whore whom I saw.
And it came to pass that I beheld that the great mother of abominations did gather together multitudes upon the face of all the
earth, among all the nations of the Gentiles, to fight against the Lamb of God.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of the
Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed with
righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.
And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was poured out upon that great and abominable church, insomuch that
there were wars and rumors of wars among all the nations and kindreds of the earth.
And as there began to be wars and rumors of wars among all the nations which belonged to the mother of abominations, the angel
spake unto me, saying:


And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, saying:


And I looked and beheld a man, and he was dressed in a white robe.
And the angel said unto me:


And I, Nephi, heard and bear record, that the name of the apostle of the Lamb was John, according to the word of the angel.
And behold, I, Nephi, am forbidden that I should write the remainder of the things which I saw and heard; wherefore the things
which I have written sufficeth me; and I have written but a small part of the things which I saw.
And I bear record that I saw the things which my father saw, and the angel of the Lord did make them known unto me.
And now I make an end of speaking concerning the things which I saw while I was carried away in the spirit; and if all the things
which I saw are not written, the things which I have written are true. And thus it is. Amen.


And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been carried away in the spirit, and seen all these things, I returned to the tent of my
father.
And it came to pass that I beheld my brethren, and they were disputing one with another concerning the things which my father had
spoken unto them.
For he truly spake many great things unto them, which were hard to be understood, save a man should inquire of the Lord; and they
being hard in their hearts, therefore they did not look unto the Lord as they ought.
And now I, Nephi, was grieved because of the hardness of their hearts, and also, because of the things which I had seen, and knew
they must unavoidably come to pass because of the great wickedness of the children of men.
And it came to pass that I was overcome because of my afflictions, for I considered that mine afflictions were great above all,
because of the destruction of my people, for I had beheld their fall.
And it came to pass that after I had received strength I spake unto my brethren, desiring to know of them the cause of their
disputations.
And they said:


And I said unto them: Have ye inquired of the Lord?
And they said unto me:


Behold, I said unto them: How is it that ye do not keep the commandments of the Lord? How is it that ye will perish, because of
the hardness of your hearts?
Do ye not remember the things which the Lord hath said?--


Behold, I say unto you, that the house of Israel was compared unto an olive tree, by the Spirit of the Lord which was in our father;
and behold are we not broken off from the house of Israel, and are we not a branch of the house of Israel?
And now, the thing which our father meaneth concerning the grafting in of the natural branches through the fulness of the
Gentiles, is, that in the latter days, when our seed shall have dwindled in unbelief, yea, for the space of many years, and many
generations after the Messiah shall be manifested in body unto the children of men, then shall the fulness of the gospel of the Messiah
come unto the Gentiles, and from the Gentiles unto the remnant of our seed?
And at that day shall the remnant of our seed know that they are of the house of Israel, and that they are the covenant people of
the Lord; and then shall they know and come to the knowledge of their forefathers, and also to the knowledge of the gospel of their
Redeemer, which was ministered unto their fathers by him; wherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer and the
very points of his doctrine, that they may know how to come unto him and be saved.
And then at that day will they not rejoice and give praise unto their everlasting God, their rock and their salvation? Yea, at that
day, will they not receive the strength and nourishment from the true vine? Yea, will they not come unto the true fold of God?
Behold, I say unto you, Yea; they shall be remembered again among the house of Israel; they shall be grafted in, being a natural
branch of the olive tree, into the true olive tree.
And this is what our father meaneth; and he meaneth that it will not come to pass until after they are scattered by the Gentiles; and
he meaneth that it shall come by way of the Gentiles, that the Lord may show his power unto the Gentiles, for the very cause that he
shall be rejected of the Jews, or of the house of Israel.
Wherefore, our father hath not spoken of our seed alone, but also of all the house of Israel, pointing to the covenant which should
be fulfilled in the latter days; which covenant the Lord made to our father Abraham, saying:


And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake much unto them concerning these things; yea, I spake unto them concerning the
restoration of the Jews in the latter days.
And I did rehearse unto them the words of Isaiah, who spake concerning the restoration of the Jews, or of the house of Israel; and
after they were restored they should no more be confounded, neither should they be scattered again. And it came to pass that I did
speak many words unto my brethren, that they were pacified and did humble themselves before the Lord.
And it came to pass that they did speak unto me again, saying:


And I said unto them: It was a representation of the tree of life.
And they said unto me:


And I said unto them that it was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it,
they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead
them away to destruction.
Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort them to give heed unto the word of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them with all the energies of my
soul, and with all the faculty which I possessed, that they would give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his
commandments always in all things.
And they said unto me:


And I said unto them that the water which my father saw was filthiness; and so much was his mind swallowed up in other things
that he beheld not the filthiness of the water.
And I said unto them that it was an awful gulf, which separated the wicked from the tree of life, and also from the saints of God.
And I said unto them that it was a representation of that awful hell, which the angel said unto me was prepared for the wicked.
And I said unto them that our father also saw that the justice of God did also divide the wicked from the righteous; and the
brightness thereof was like unto the brightness of a flaming fire, which ascendeth up unto God forever and ever, and hath no end.
And they said unto me:


And it came to pass that I said unto them that it was a representation of things both temporal and spiritual; for the day should
come that they must be judged of their works, yea, even the works which were done by the temporal body in their days of probation.
Wherefore, if they should die in their wickedness they must be cast off also, as to the things which are spiritual, which are
pertaining to righteousness; wherefore, they must be brought to stand before God, to be judged of their works; and if their works have
been filthiness they must needs be filthy; and if they be filthy it must needs be that they cannot dwell in the kingdom of God; if so, the
kingdom of God must be filthy also.
But behold, I say unto you, the kingdom of God is not filthy, and there cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God;
wherefore there must needs be a place of filthiness prepared for that which is filthy.
And there is a place prepared, yea, even that awful hell of which I have spoken, and the devil is the preparator of it; wherefore the
final state of the souls of men is to dwell in the kingdom of God, or to be cast out because of that justice of which I have spoken.
Wherefore, the wicked are rejected from the righteous, and also from that tree of life, whose fruit is most precious and most
desirable above all other fruits; yea, and it is the greatest of all the gifts of God. And thus I spake unto my brethren. Amen.


And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end of speaking to my brethren, behold they said unto me:


And it came to pass that I said unto them that I knew that I had spoken hard things against the wicked, according to the truth; and
the righteous have I justified, and testified that they should be lifted up at the last day; wherefore, the guilty taketh the truth to be hard,
for it cutteth them to the very center.
And now my brethren, if ye were righteous and were willing to hearken to the truth, and give heed unto it, that ye might walk
uprightly before God, then ye would not murmur because of the truth, and say:


And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did exhort my brethren, with all diligence, to keep the commandments of the Lord.
And it came to pass that they did humble themselves before the Lord; insomuch that I had joy and great hopes of them, that they
would walk in the paths of righteousness.
Now, all these things were said and done as my father dwelt in a tent in the valley which he called Lemuel.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, took one of the daughters of Ishmael to wife; and also, my brethren took of the daughters of
Ishmael to wife; and also Zoram took the eldest daughter of Ishmael to wife.
And thus my father had fulfilled all the commandments of the Lord which had been given unto him. And also, I, Nephi, had been
blessed of the Lord exceedingly.
And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord spake unto my father by night, and commanded him that on the morrow he should
take his journey into the wilderness.
And it came to pass that as my father arose in the morning, and went forth to the tent door, to his great astonishment he beheld
upon the ground a round ball of curious workmanship; and it was of fine brass. And within the ball were two spindles; and the one
pointed the way whither we should go into the wilderness.
And it came to pass that we did gather together whatsoever things we should carry into the wilderness, and all the remainder of
our provisions which the Lord had given unto us; and we did take seed of every kind that we might carry into the wilderness.
And it came to pass that we did take our tents and depart into the wilderness, across the river Laman.
And it came to pass that we traveled for the space of four days, nearly a south-southeast direction, and we did pitch our tents
again; and we did call the name of the place Shazer.
And it came to pass that we did take our bows and our arrows, and go forth into the wilderness to slay food for our families; and
after we had slain food for our families we did return again to our families in the wilderness, to the place of Shazer. And we did go
forth again in the wilderness, following the same direction, keeping in the most fertile parts of the wilderness, which were in the
borders near the Red Sea.
And it came to pass that we did travel for the space of many days, slaying food by the way, with our bows and our arrows and our
stones and our slings.
And we did follow the directions of the ball, which led us in the more fertile parts of the wilderness.
And after we had traveled for the space of many days, we did pitch our tents for the space of a time, that we might again rest
ourselves and obtain food for our families.
And it came to pass that as I, Nephi, went forth to slay food, behold, I did break my bow, which was made of fine steel; and after I
did break my bow, behold, my brethren were angry with me because of the loss of my bow, for we did obtain no food.
And it came to pass that we did return without food to our families, and being much fatigued, because of their journeying, they
did suffer much for the want of food.
And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael did begin to murmur exceedingly, because of their sufferings
and afflictions in the wilderness; and also my father began to murmur against the Lord his God; yea, and they were all exceedingly
sorrowful, even that they did murmur against the Lord.
Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, having been afflicted with my brethren because of the loss of my bow, and their bows having
lost their springs, it began to be exceedingly difficult, yea, insomuch that we could obtain no food.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did speak much unto my brethren, because they had hardened their hearts again, even unto
complaining against the Lord their God.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make out of wood a bow, and out of a straight stick, an arrow; wherefore, I did arm myself
with a bow and an arrow, with a sling and with stones. And I said unto my father: Whither shall I go to obtain food?
And it came to pass that he did inquire of the Lord, for they had humbled themselves because of my words; for I did say many
things unto them in the energy of my soul.
And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my father; and he was truly chastened because of his murmuring against
the Lord, insomuch that he was brought down into the depths of sorrow.
And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord said unto him:


And it came to pass that when my father beheld the things which were written upon the ball, he did fear and tremble exceedingly,
and also my brethren and the sons of Ishmael and our wives.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the pointers which were in the ball, that they did work according to the faith and
diligence and heed which we did give unto them.
And there was also written upon them a new writing, which was plain to be read, which did give us understanding concerning the
ways of the Lord; and it was written and changed from time to time, according to the faith and diligence which we gave unto it. And
thus we see that by small means the Lord can bring about great things.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did go forth up into the top of the mountain, according to the directions which were given upon
the ball.
And it came to pass that I did slay wild beasts, insomuch that I did obtain food for our families.
And it came to pass that I did return to our tents, bearing the beasts which I had slain; and now when they beheld that I had
obtained food, how great was their joy! And it came to pass that they did humble themselves before the Lord, and did give thanks unto
him.
And it came to pass that we did again take our journey, traveling nearly the same course as in the beginning; and after we had
traveled for the space of many days we did pitch our tents again, that we might tarry for the space of a time.
And it came to pass that Ishmael died, and was buried in the place which was called Nahom.
And it came to pass that the daughters of Ishmael did mourn exceedingly, because of the loss of their father, and because of their
afflictions in the wilderness; and they did murmur against my father, because he had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem,
saying:


And thus they did murmur against my father, and also against me; and they were desirous to return again to Jerusalem.
And Laman said unto Lemuel and also unto the sons of Ishmael:


And after this manner did my brother Laman stir up their hearts to anger.
And it came to pass that the Lord was with us, yea, even the voice of the Lord came and did speak many words unto them, and did
chasten them exceedingly; and after they were chastened by the voice of the Lord they did turn away their anger, and did repent of
their sins, insomuch that the Lord did bless us again with food, that we did not perish.


And it came to pass that we did again take our journey in the wilderness; and we did travel nearly eastward from that time forth.
And we did travel and wade through much affliction in the wilderness; and our women did bear children in the wilderness.
And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that while we did live upon raw meat in the wilderness, our women did give
plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea, even like unto the men; and they began to bear their journeyings without
murmurings.
And thus we see that the commandments of God must be fulfilled. And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments
of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has
commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means for us while we did sojourn in the wilderness.
And we did sojourn for the space of many years, yea, even eight years in the wilderness.
And we did come to the land which we called Bountiful, because of its much fruit and also wild honey; and all these things were
prepared of the Lord that we might not perish. And we beheld the sea, which we called Irreantum, which, being interpreted, is many
waters.
And it came to pass that we did pitch our tents by the seashore; and notwithstanding we had suffered many afflictions and much
difficulty, yea, even so much that we cannot write them all, we were exceedingly rejoiced when we came to the seashore; and we
called the place Bountiful, because of its much fruit.
And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been in the land of Bountiful for the space of many days, the voice of the Lord came
unto me, saying:


And it came to pass that I arose and went up into the mountain, and cried unto the Lord.
And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying:


And I said: Lord, whither shall I go that I may find ore to molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship after the manner
which thou hast shown unto me?
And it came to pass that the Lord told me whither I should go to find ore, that I might make tools.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make a bellows wherewith to blow the fire, of the skins of beasts; and after I had made a
bellows, that I might have wherewith to blow the fire, I did smite two stones together that I might make fire.
For the Lord had not hitherto suffered that we should make much fire, as we journeyed in the wilderness; for he said:


Yea, and the Lord said also that:


Wherefore, I, Nephi, did strive to keep the commandments of the Lord, and I did exhort my brethren to faithfulness and diligence.
And it came to pass that I did make tools of the ore which I did molten out of the rock.
And when my brethren saw that I was about to build a ship, they began to murmur against me, saying:


And thus my brethren did complain against me, and were desirous that they might not labor, for they did not believe that I could
build a ship; neither would they believe that I was instructed of the Lord.
And now it came to pass that I, Nephi, was exceedingly sorrowful because of the hardness of their hearts; and now when they saw
that I began to be sorrowful they were glad in their hearts, insomuch that they did rejoice over me, saying:


And after this manner of language did my brethren murmur and complain against us.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake unto them, saying: Do ye believe that our fathers, who were the children of Israel, would
have been led away out of the hands of the Egyptians if they had not hearkened unto the words of the Lord?
Yea, do ye suppose that they would have been led out of bondage, if the Lord had not commanded Moses that he should lead
them out of bondage?
Now ye know that the children of Israel were in bondage; and ye know that they were laden with tasks, which were grievous to be
borne; wherefore, ye know that it must needs be a good thing for them, that they should be brought out of bondage.
Now ye know that Moses was commanded of the Lord to do that great work; and ye know that by his word the waters of the Red
Sea were divided hither and thither, and they passed through on dry ground.
But ye know that the Egyptians were drowned in the Red Sea, who were the armies of Pharaoh.
And ye also know that they were fed with manna in the wilderness.
Yea, and ye also know that Moses, by his word according to the power of God which was in him, smote the rock, and there came
forth water, that the children of Israel might quench their thirst.
And notwithstanding they being led, the Lord their God, their Redeemer, going before them, leading them by day and giving light
unto them by night, and doing all things for them which were expedient for man to receive, they hardened their hearts and blinded
their minds, and reviled against Moses and against the true and living God.
And it came to pass that according to his word he did destroy them; and according to his word he did lead them; and according to
his word he did do all things for them; and there was not any thing done save it were by his word.
And after they had crossed the river Jordan he did make them mighty unto the driving out of the children of the land, yea, unto the
scattering them to destruction.
And now, do ye suppose that the children of this land, who were in the land of promise, who were driven out by our fathers, do ye
suppose that they were righteous? Behold, I say unto you, Nay.
Do ye suppose that our fathers would have been more choice than they if they had been righteous? I say unto you, Nay.
Behold, the Lord esteemeth all flesh in one; he that is righteous is favored of God. But behold, this people had rejected every
word of God, and they were ripe in iniquity; and the fulness of the wrath of God was upon them; and the Lord did curse the land
against them, and bless it unto our fathers; yea, he did curse it against them unto their destruction, and he did bless it unto our fathers
unto their obtaining power over it.
Behold, the Lord hath created the earth that it should be inhabited; and he hath created his children that they should possess it.
And he raiseth up a righteous nation, and destroyeth the nations of the wicked.
And he leadeth away the righteous into precious lands, and the wicked he destroyeth, and curseth the land unto them for their
sakes.
He ruleth high in the heavens, for it is his throne, and this earth is his footstool.
And he loveth those who will have him to be their God. Behold, he loved our fathers, and he covenanted with them, yea, even
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and he remembered the covenants which he had made; wherefore, he did bring them out of the land of
Egypt.
And he did straiten them in the wilderness with his rod; for they hardened their hearts, even as ye have; and the Lord straitened
them because of their iniquity. He sent fiery flying serpents among them; and after they were bitten he prepared a way that they might
be healed; and the labor which they had to perform was to look; and because of the simpleness of the way, or the easiness of it, there
were many who perished.
And they did harden their hearts from time to time, and they did revile against Moses, and also against God; nevertheless, ye
know that they were led forth by his matchless power into the land of promise.
And now, after all these things, the time has come that they have become wicked, yea, nearly unto ripeness; and I know not but
they are at this day about to be destroyed; for I know that the day must surely come that they must be destroyed, save a few only, who
shall be led away into captivity.
Wherefore, the Lord commanded my father that he should depart into the wilderness; and the Jews also sought to take away his
life; yea, and ye also have sought to take away his life; wherefore, ye are murderers in your hearts and ye are like unto them.
Ye are swift to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord your God. Ye have seen an angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye have
heard his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel
his words; wherefore, he has spoken unto you like unto the voice of thunder, which did cause the earth to shake as if it were to divide
asunder.
And ye also know that by the power of his almighty word he can cause the earth that it shall pass away; yea, and ye know that by
his word he can cause the rough places to be made smooth, and smooth places shall be broken up. O, then, why is it, that ye can be so
hard in your hearts?
Behold, my soul is rent with anguish because of you, and my heart is pained; I fear lest ye shall be cast off forever. Behold, I am
full of the Spirit of God, insomuch that my frame has no strength.
And now it came to pass that when I had spoken these words they were angry with me, and were desirous to throw me into the
depths of the sea; and as they came forth to lay their hands upon me I spake unto them, saying: In the name of the Almighty God, I
command you that ye touch me not, for I am filled with the power of God, even unto the consuming of my flesh; and whoso shall lay
his hands upon me shall wither even as a dried reed; and he shall be as naught before the power of God, for God shall smite him.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto them that they should murmur no more against their father; neither should they
withhold their labor from me, for God had commanded me that I should build a ship.
And I said unto them: If God had commanded me to do all things I could do them. If he should command me that I should say
unto this water, be thou earth, it should be earth; and if I should say it, it would be done.
And now, if the Lord has such great power, and has wrought so many miracles among the children of men, how is it that he
cannot instruct me, that I should build a ship?
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said many things unto my brethren, insomuch that they were confounded and could not contend
against me; neither durst they lay their hands upon me nor touch me with their fingers, even for the space of many days. Now they
durst not do this lest they should wither before me, so powerful was the Spirit of God; and thus it had wrought upon them.
And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me:


saith the Lord,


And it came to pass that I stretched forth my hand unto my brethren, and they did not wither before me; but the Lord did shake
them, even according to the word which he had spoken.
And now, they said:


And they fell down before me, and were about to worship me, but I would not suffer them, saying: I am thy brother, yea, even thy
younger brother; wherefore, worship the Lord thy God, and honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land
which the Lord thy God shall give thee.


And it came to pass that they did worship the Lord, and did go forth with me; and we did work timbers of curious workmanship.
And the Lord did show me from time to time after what manner I should work the timbers of the ship.
Now I, Nephi, did not work the timbers after the manner which was learned by men, neither did I build the ship after the manner of
men; but I did build it after the manner which the Lord had shown unto me; wherefore, it was not after the manner of men.
And I, Nephi, did go into the mount oft, and I did pray oft unto the Lord; wherefore the Lord showed unto me great things.
And it came to pass that after I had finished the ship, according to the word of the Lord, my brethren beheld that it was good, and
that the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine; wherefore, they did humble themselves again before the Lord.
And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my father, that we should arise and go down into the ship.
And it came to pass that on the morrow, after we had prepared all things, much fruits and meat from the wilderness, and honey in
abundance, and provisions according to that which the Lord had commanded us, we did go down into the ship, with all our loading
and our seeds, and whatsoever thing we had brought with us, every one according to his age; wherefore, we did all go down into the
ship, with our wives and our children.
And now, my father had begat two sons in the wilderness; the elder was called Jacob and the younger Joseph.
And it came to pass after we had all gone down into the ship, and had taken with us our provisions and things which had been
commanded us, we did put forth into the sea and were driven forth before the wind towards the promised land.
And after we had been driven forth before the wind for the space of many days, behold, my brethren and the sons of Ishmael and
also their wives began to make themselves merry, insomuch that they began to dance, and to sing, and to speak with much rudeness,
yea, even that they did forget by what power they had been brought thither; yea, they were lifted up unto exceeding rudeness.
And I, Nephi, began to fear exceedingly lest the Lord should be angry with us, and smite us because of our iniquity, that we
should be swallowed up in the depths of the sea; wherefore, I, Nephi, began to speak to them with much soberness; but behold they
were angry with me, saying:


And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel did take me and bind me with cords, and they did treat me with much harshness;
nevertheless, the Lord did suffer it that he might show forth his power, unto the fulfilling of his word which he had spoken concerning
the wicked.
And it came to pass that after they had bound me insomuch that I could not move, the compass, which had been prepared of the
Lord, did cease to work.
Wherefore, they knew not whither they should steer the ship, insomuch that there arose a great storm, yea, a great and terrible
tempest, and we were driven back upon the waters for the space of three days; and they began to be frightened exceedingly lest they
should be drowned in the sea; nevertheless they did not loose me.
And on the fourth day, which we had been driven back, the tempest began to be exceedingly sore.
And it came to pass that we were about to be swallowed up in the depths of the sea. And after we had been driven back upon the
waters for the space of four days, my brethren began to see that the judgments of God were upon them, and that they must perish save
that they should repent of their iniquities; wherefore, they came unto me, and loosed the bands which were upon my wrists, and
behold they had swollen exceedingly; and also mine ankles were much swollen, and great was the soreness thereof.
Nevertheless, I did look unto my God, and I did praise him all the day long; and I did not murmur against the Lord because of
mine afflictions.
Now my father, Lehi, had said many things unto them, and also unto the sons of Ishmael; but, behold, they did breathe out much
threatenings against anyone that should speak for me; and my parents being stricken in years, and having suffered much grief because
of their children, they were brought down, yea, even upon their sick-beds.
Because of their grief and much sorrow, and the iniquity of my brethren, they were brought near even to be carried out of this
time to meet their God; yea, their grey hairs were about to be brought down to lie low in the dust; yea, even they were near to be cast
with sorrow into a watery grave.
And Jacob and Joseph also, being young, having need of much nourishment, were grieved because of the afflictions of their
mother; and also my wife with her tears and prayers, and also my children, did not soften the hearts of my brethren that they would
loose me.
And there was nothing save it were the power of God, which threatened them with destruction, could soften their hearts;
wherefore, when they saw that they were about to be swallowed up in the depths of the sea they repented of the thing which they had
done, insomuch that they loosed me.
And it came to pass after they had loosed me, behold, I took the compass, and it did work whither I desired it. And it came to pass
that I prayed unto the Lord; and after I had prayed the winds did cease, and the storm did cease, and there was a great calm.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did guide the ship, that we sailed again towards the promised land.
And it came to pass that after we had sailed for the space of many days we did arrive at the promised land; and we went forth
upon the land, and did pitch our tents; and we did call it the promised land.
And it came to pass that we did begin to till the earth, and we began to plant seeds; yea, we did put all our seeds into the earth,
which we had brought from the land of Jerusalem. And it came to pass that they did grow exceedingly; wherefore, we were blessed in
abundance.
And it came to pass that we did find upon the land of promise, as we journeyed in the wilderness, that there were beasts in the
forests of every kind, both the cow and the ox, and the ass and the horse, and the goat and the wild goat, and all manner of wild
animals, which were for the use of men. And we did find all manner of ore, both of gold, and of silver, and of copper.


And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me, wherefore I did make plates of ore that I might engraven upon them the record
of my people. And upon the plates which I made I did engraven the record of my father, and also our journeyings in the wilderness,
and the prophecies of my father; and also many of mine own prophecies have I engraven upon them.
And I knew not at the time when I made them that I should be commanded of the Lord to make these plates; wherefore, the record
of my father, and the genealogy of his fathers, and the more part of all our proceedings in the wilderness are engraven upon those first
plates of which I have spoken; wherefore, the things which transpired before I made these plates are, of a truth, more particularly
made mention upon the first plates.
And after I had made these plates by way of commandment, I, Nephi, received a commandment that the ministry and the
prophecies, the more plain and precious parts of them, should be written upon these plates; and that the things which were written
should be kept for the instruction of my people, who should possess the land, and also for other wise purposes, which purposes are
known unto the Lord.
Wherefore, I, Nephi, did make a record upon the other plates, which gives an account, or which gives a greater account of the wars
and contentions and destructions of my people. And this have I done, and commanded my people what they should do after I was
gone; and that these plates should be handed down from one generation to another, or from one prophet to another, until further
commandments of the Lord.
And an account of my making these plates shall be given hereafter; and then, behold, I proceed according to that which I have
spoken; and this I do that the more sacred things may be kept for the knowledge of my people.
Nevertheless, I do not write anything upon plates save it be that I think it be sacred. And now, if I do err, even did they err of old;
not that I would excuse myself because of other men, but because of the weakness which is in me, according to the flesh, I would
excuse myself.
For the things which some men esteem to be of great worth, both to the body and soul, others set at naught and trample under their
feet. Yea, even the very God of Israel do men trample under their feet; I say, trample under their feet but I would speak in other
words--they set him at naught, and hearken not to the voice of his counsels.
And behold he cometh, according to the words of the angel, in six hundred years from the time my father left Jerusalem.
And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it;
and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving kindness and his long-
suffering towards the children of men.
And the God of our fathers, who were led out of Egypt, out of bondage, and also were preserved in the wilderness by him, yea,
the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, yieldeth himself, according to the words of the angel, as a man, into the
hands of wicked men, to be lifted up, according to the words of Zenock, and to be crucified, according to the words of Neum, and to
be buried in a sepulchre, according to the words of Zenos, which he spake concerning the three days of darkness, which should be a
sign given of his death unto those who should inhabit the isles of the sea, more especially given unto those who are of the house of
Israel.
For thus spake the prophet:


saith the prophet Zenos.


saith the prophet,


saith the prophet,


saith the prophet,


according to the words of the prophet Zenos,


saith the prophet;


And I, Nephi, have written these things unto my people, that perhaps I might persuade them that they would remember the Lord
their Redeemer.
Wherefore, I speak unto all the house of Israel, if it so be that they should obtain these things.
For behold, I have workings in the spirit, which doth weary me even that all my joints are weak, for those who are at Jerusalem;
for had not the Lord been merciful, to show unto me concerning them, even as he had prophets of old, I should have perished also.
And he surely did show unto the prophets of old all things concerning them; and also he did show unto many concerning us;
wherefore, it must needs be that we know concerning them for they are written upon the plates of brass.
Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, did teach my brethren these things; and it came to pass that I did read many things to them,
which were engraven upon the plates of brass, that they might know concerning the doings of the Lord in other lands, among people
of old.
And I did read many things unto them which were written in the books of Moses; but that I might more fully persuade them to
believe in the Lord their Redeemer I did read unto them that which was written by the prophet Isaiah; for I did liken all scriptures unto
us, that it might be for our profit and learning.
Wherefore I spake unto them, saying: Hear ye the words of the prophet, ye who are a remnant of the house of Israel, a branch who
have been broken off; hear ye the words of the prophet, which were written unto all the house of Israel, and liken them unto
yourselves, that ye may have hope as well as your brethren from whom ye have been broken off; for after this manner has the prophet
written.


And again:


And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had read these things which were engraven upon the plates of brass, my brethren came
unto me and said unto me:


And I, Nephi, said unto them: Behold they were manifest unto the prophet by the voice of the Spirit; for by the Spirit are all things
made known unto the prophets, which shall come upon the children of men according to the flesh.
Wherefore, the things of which I have read are things pertaining to things both temporal and spiritual; for it appears that the house
of Israel, sooner or later, will be scattered upon all the face of the earth, and also among all nations.
And behold, there are many who are already lost from the knowledge of those who are at Jerusalem. Yea, the more part of all the
tribes have been led away; and they are scattered to and fro  upon the isles of the sea;  and whither they are none of us knoweth, save
that we know that they have been led away.
And since they have been led away, these things have been prophesied concerning them, and also concerning all those who shall
hereafter be scattered and be confounded, because of the Holy One of Israel; for against him will they harden their hearts; wherefore,
they shall be scattered among all nations and shall be hated of all men.
Nevertheless, after they shall be nursed  by the Gentiles, and the Lord has lifted up his hand upon the Gentiles and set them up for
a standard, and their children have been carried in their arms, and their daughters have been carried upon their shoulders,  behold
these things of which are spoken are temporal; for thus are the covenants of the Lord with our fathers; and it meaneth us in the days to
come, and also all our brethren who are of the house of Israel.
And it meaneth that the time cometh that after all the house of Israel have been scattered and confounded, that the Lord God will
raise up a mighty  nation among the Gentiles, yea, even upon the face of this land; and by them shall our seed be scattered.
And after our seed is scattered the Lord God will proceed to do a marvelous work  among the Gentiles, which shall be of great
worth unto our seed; wherefore, it is likened unto their being nourished by the Gentiles and being carried in their arms and upon their
shoulders.
And it shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles; and not only unto the Gentiles but unto all the house of Israel, unto the making
known of the covenants of the Father of heaven unto Abraham, saying:


And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the kindreds of the earth cannot be blessed unless he shall make bare his
arm in the eyes of the nations.
Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm in the eyes of all the nations, in bringing about his covenants and his
gospel unto those who are of the house of Israel.
Wherefore, he will bring them again out of captivity, and they shall be gathered together to the lands of their inheritance; and they
shall be brought out of obscurity and out of darkness;  and they shall know that the Lord is their Savior and their Redeemer, the
Mighty One of Israel.
And the blood of that great and abominable church, which is the whore of all the earth, shall turn upon their own heads; for they
shall war among themselves, and the sword of their own hands shall fall upon their own heads, and they shall be drunken with their
own blood.
And every nation which shall war against thee, O house of Israel, shall be turned one against another, and they shall fall into the
pit which they digged to ensnare the people of the Lord. And all that fight against Zion  shall be destroyed, and that great whore, who
hath perverted the right ways of the Lord, yea, that great and abominable church, shall tumble to the dust and great shall be the fall of
it.


saith the prophet,


for thus saith the prophet,


Behold, my brethren, I say unto you, that these things must shortly come; yea, even blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke must
come; and it must needs be upon the face of this earth; and it cometh unto men according to the flesh if it so be that they will harden
their hearts against the Holy One of Israel.
For behold, the righteous shall not perish; for the time surely must come that all they who fight against Zion  shall be cut off.
And the Lord will surely prepare a way for his people, unto the fulfilling of the words of Moses, which he spake, saying:


And now I, Nephi, declare unto you, that this prophet of whom Moses spake was the Holy One of Israel; wherefore, he shall
execute judgment in righteousness.
And the righteous need not fear, for they are those who shall not be confounded. But it is the kingdom of the devil, which shall be
built up among the children of men, which kingdom is established among them which are in the flesh?
For the time speedily shall come that all churches which are built up to get gain, and all those who are built up to get power over
the flesh, and those who are built up to become popular in the eyes of the world, and those who seek the lusts of the flesh and the
things of the world, and to do all manner of iniquity; yea, in fine, all those who belong to the kingdom of the devil are they who need
fear, and tremble, and quake; they are those who must be brought low in the dust;  they are those who must be consumed as stubble;
and this is according to the words of the prophet.
And the time cometh speedily that the righteous must be led up as calves of the stall,  and the Holy One of Israel must reign in
dominion, and might, and power, and great glory.
And he gathereth his children from the four quarters of the earth;  and he numbereth his sheep, and they know him; and there
shall be one fold and one shepherd; and he shall feed his sheep, and in him they shall find pasture.
And because of the righteousness of his people, Satan has no power; wherefore, he cannot be loosed for the space of many years;
for he hath no power over the hearts of the people, for they dwell in righteousness, and the Holy One of Israel reigneth.
And now behold, I, Nephi, say unto you that all these things must come according to the flesh.
But, behold, all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people shall dwell safely in the Holy One of Israel if it so be that they will repent.
And now I, Nephi, make an end; for I durst not speak further as yet concerning these things.
Wherefore, my brethren, I would that ye should consider that the things which have been written upon the plates of brass are true;
and they testify that a man must be obedient to the commandments of God.
Wherefore, ye need not suppose that I and my father are the only ones that have testified, and also taught them. Wherefore, if ye
shall be obedient to the commandments, and endure to the end, ye shall be saved at the last day. And thus it is. Amen.


THE SECOND BOOK OF NEPHI

An account of the death of Lehi. Nephi's brethren rebel against him. The Lord warns Nephi to depart into the wilderness. His
journeyings in the wilderness, and so forth.



And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end of teaching my brethren, our father, Lehi, also spake many things
unto them, and rehearsed unto them, how great things the Lord had done for them in bringing them out of the land of Jerusalem.
And he spake unto them concerning their rebellions upon the waters, and the mercies of God in sparing their lives, that they were
not swallowed up in the sea.
And he also spake unto them concerning the land of promise, which they had obtained--how merciful the Lord had been in
warning us that we should flee out of the land of Jerusalem.


said he,


said he,


And now, I, Nephi, speak concerning the prophecies of which my father hath spoken, concerning Joseph, who was carried into
Egypt.
For behold, he truly prophesied concerning all his seed. And the prophecies which he wrote, there are not many greater. And he
prophesied concerning us, and our future generations; and they are written upon the plates of brass.
Wherefore, after my father had made an end of speaking concerning the prophecies of Joseph, he called the children of Laman, his
sons, and his daughters, and said unto them:


And it came to pass that after my father had made an end of speaking to the sons and daughters of Laman, he caused the sons and
daughters of Lemuel to be brought before him.
And he spake unto them, saying:


And it came to pass that when my father had made an end of speaking unto them, behold, he spake unto the sons of Ishmael, yea,
and even all his household.
And after he had made an end of speaking unto them, he spake unto Sam, saying:


And it came to pass after my father, Lehi, had spoken unto all his household, according to the feelings of his heart and the Spirit
of the Lord which was in him, he waxed old. And it came to pass that he died, and was buried.
And it came to pass that not many days after his death, Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael were angry with me because
of the admonitions of the Lord.
For I, Nephi, was constrained to speak unto them, according to his word; for I had spoken many things unto them, and also my
father, before his death; many of which sayings are written upon mine other plates; for a more history part are written upon mine other
plates.
And upon these I write the things of my soul, and many of the scriptures which are engraven upon the plates of brass. For my soul
delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and the profit of my children.
Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and
heard.
Nevertheless, notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord, in showing me his great and marvelous works, my heart
exclaimeth: O wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.
I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me.
And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted.
My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the
waters of the great deep.
He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh.
He hath confounded mine enemies, unto the causing of them to quake before me.
Behold, he hath heard my cry by day, and he hath given me knowledge by visions in the night-time.
And by day have I waxed bold in mighty prayer before him; yea, my voice have I sent up on high; and angels came down and
ministered unto me.
And upon the wings of his Spirit hath my body been carried away upon exceedingly high mountains. And mine eyes have beheld
great things, yea, even too great for man; therefore I was bidden that I should not write them.
O then, if I have seen so great things, if the Lord in his condescension unto the children of men hath visited men in so much
mercy, why should my heart weep and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my strength slacken,
because of mine afflictions?
And why should I yield to sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why should I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my
heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry because of mine enemy?
Awake, my soul! No longer droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul.
Do not anger again because of mine enemies. Do not slacken my strength because of mine afflictions.
Rejoice, O my heart, and cry unto the Lord, and say: O Lord, I will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my God,
and the rock of my salvation.
O Lord, wilt thou redeem my soul? Wilt thou deliver me out of the hands of mine enemies? Wilt thou make me that I may shake
at the appearance of sin?
May the gates of hell be shut continually before me, because that my heart is broken and my spirit is contrite! O Lord, wilt thou
not shut the gates of thy righteousness before me, that I may walk in the path of the low valley, that I may be strict in the plain road!
O Lord, wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy righteousness! O Lord, wilt thou make a way for mine escape before mine
enemies! Wilt thou make my path straight before me! Wilt thou not place a stumbling block in my way--but that thou wouldst clear
my way before me, and hedge not up my way, but the ways of mine enemy.
O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh; for I know that cursed is
he that putteth his trust in the arm of flesh. Yea, cursed is he that putteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm.
Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; therefore I will lift up
my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock of my righteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto
thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen.


Behold, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cry much unto the Lord my God, because of the anger of my brethren.
But behold, their anger did increase against me, insomuch that they did seek to take away my life.
Yea, they did murmur against me, saying:


Now I do not write upon these plates all the words which they murmured against me. But it sufficeth me to say, that they did seek
to take away my life.
And it came to pass that the Lord did warn me, that I, Nephi, should depart from them and flee into the wilderness, and all those
who would go with me.
Wherefore, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did take my family, and also Zoram and his family, and Sam, mine elder brother and his
family, and Jacob and Joseph, my younger brethren, and also my sisters, and all those who would go with me. And all those who
would go with me were those who believed in the warnings and the revelations of God; wherefore, they did hearken unto my words.
And we did take our tents and whatsoever things were possible for us, and did journey in the wilderness for the space of many
days. And after we had journeyed for the space of many days we did pitch our tents.
And my people would that we should call the name of the place Nephi; wherefore, we did call it Nephi.
And all those who were with me did take upon them to call themselves the people of Nephi.
And we did observe to keep the judgments, and the statutes, and the commandments of the Lord in all things, according to the law
of Moses.
And the Lord was with us; and we did prosper exceedingly; for we did sow seed, and we did reap again in abundance. And we
began to raise flocks, and herds, and animals of every kind.
And I, Nephi, had also brought the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass; and also the ball, or compass, which
was prepared for my father by the hand of the Lord, according to that which is written.
And it came to pass that we began to prosper exceedingly, and to multiply in the land.
And I, Nephi, did take the sword of Laban, and after the manner of it did make many swords, lest by any means the people who
were now called Lamanites should come upon us and destroy us; for I knew their hatred towards me and my children and those who
were called my people.
And I did teach my people to build buildings, and to work in all manner of wood, and of iron, and of copper, and of brass, and of
steel, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious ores, which were in great abundance.
And I, Nephi, did build a temple; and I did construct it after the manner of the temple of Solomon save it were not built of so
many precious things; for they were not to be found upon the land, wherefore, it could not be built like unto Solomon's temple. But
the manner of the construction was like unto the temple of Solomon; and the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cause my people to be industrious, and to labor with their hands.
And it came to pass that they would that I should be their king. But I, Nephi, was desirous that they should have no king;
nevertheless, I did for them according to that which was in my power.
And behold, the words of the Lord had been fulfilled unto my brethren, which he spake concerning them, that I should be their
ruler and their teacher. Wherefore, I had been their ruler and their teacher, according to the commandments of the Lord, until the time
they sought to take away my life.
Wherefore, the word of the Lord was fulfilled which he spake unto me, saying that:


And behold, they were cut off from his presence.
And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had
hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and
delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.
And thus saith the Lord God:


And the Lord spake it, and it was done.
And because of their cursing which was upon them they did become an idle people, full of mischief and subtlety, and did seek in
the wilderness for beasts of prey.
And the Lord God said unto me:


And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did consecrate Jacob and Joseph, that they should be priests and teachers over the land of my
people.
And it came to pass that we lived after the manner of happiness.
And thirty years had passed away from the time we left Jerusalem.
And I, Nephi, had kept the records upon my plates, which I had made, of my people thus far.
And it came to pass that the Lord God said unto me:


Wherefore, I, Nephi, to be obedient to the commandments of the Lord, went and made these plates upon which I have engraven
these things.
And I engraved that which is pleasing unto God. And if my people are pleased with the things of God they will be pleased with
mine engravings which are upon these plates.
And if my people desire to know the more particular part of the history of my people they must search mine other plates.
And it sufficeth me to say that forty years had passed away, and we had already had wars and contentions with our brethren.


The words of Jacob, the brother of Nephi, which he spake unto the people of Nephi:


And now, Jacob spake many more things to my people at that time; nevertheless only these things have I caused to be written, for
the things which I have written sufficeth me.
And now I, Nephi, write more of the words of Isaiah, for my soul delighteth in his words. For I will liken his words unto my
people, and I will send them forth unto all my children, for he verily saw my Redeemer, even as I have seen him.
And my brother, Jacob, also has seen him as I have seen him; wherefore, I will send their words forth unto my children to prove
unto them that my words are true. Wherefore,


God hath said,


Nevertheless, God sendeth more witnesses, and he proveth all his words.
Behold, my soul delighteth in proving unto my people the truth of the coming of Christ; for, for this end hath the law of Moses
been given; and all things which have been given of God from the beginning of the world, unto man, are the typifying of him.
And also my soul delighteth in the covenants of the Lord which he hath made to our fathers; yea, my soul delighteth in his grace,
and in his justice, and power, and mercy in the great and eternal plan of deliverance from death.
And my soul delighteth in proving unto my people that save Christ should come all men must perish.
For if there be no Christ there be no God; and if there be no God we are not, for there could have been no creation. But there is a
God, and he is Christ, and he cometh in the fulness of his own time.
And now I write some of the words of Isaiah, that whoso of my people shall see these words may lift up their hearts and rejoice for
all men. Now these are the words, and ye may liken them unto you and unto all men.


Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat concerning the words which I have written, which have been spoken by the mouth of Isaiah. For
behold, Isaiah spake many things which were hard for many of my people to understand; for they know not concerning the manner of
prophesying among the Jews.
For I, Nephi, have not taught them many things concerning the manner of the Jews; for their works were works of darkness, and
their doings were doings of abominations.
Wherefore, I write unto my people, unto all those that shall receive hereafter these things which I write, that they may know the
judgments of God, that they come upon all nations, according to the word which he hath spoken.
Wherefore, hearken, O my people,  which are of the house of Israel, and give ear unto my words; for because the words of Isaiah
are not plain unto you, nevertheless they are plain unto all those that are filled with the spirit of prophecy. But I give unto you a
prophecy, according to the spirit which is in me; wherefore I shall prophesy according to the plainness which hath been with me from
the time that I came out from Jerusalem with my father; for behold, my soul delighteth in plainness unto my people, that they may
learn.
Yea, and my soul delighteth in the words of Isaiah, for I came out from Jerusalem, and mine eyes hath beheld the things of the
Jews, and I know that the Jews do understand the things of the prophets, and there is none other people that understand the things
which were spoken unto the Jews like unto them, save it be that they are taught after the manner of the things of the Jews.
But behold, I, Nephi, have not taught my children after the manner of the Jews; but behold, I, of myself, have dwelt at Jerusalem,
wherefore I know concerning the regions round about; and I have made mention unto my children concerning the judgments of God,
which hath come to pass among the Jews, unto my children, according to all that which Isaiah hath spoken, and I do not write them.
But behold, I proceed with mine own prophecy, according to my plainness; in the which I know that no man can err; nevertheless,
in the days that the prophecies of Isaiah shall be fulfilled men shall know of a surety, at the times when they shall come to pass.
Wherefore, they are of worth unto the children of men, and he that supposeth that they are not, unto them will I speak particularly,
and confine the words unto mine own people; for I know that they shall be of great worth unto them in the last days; for in that day
shall they understand them; wherefore, for their good have I written them.
And as one generation hath been destroyed among the Jews because of iniquity, even so have they been destroyed from generation
to generation according to their iniquities; and never hath any of them been destroyed save it were foretold them by the prophets of the
Lord.
Wherefore, it hath been told them concerning the destruction which should come upon them, immediately after my father left
Jerusalem; nevertheless, they hardened their hearts; and according to my prophecy they have been destroyed, save it be those which
are carried away captive into Babylon.
And now this I speak because of the spirit which is in me. And notwithstanding they have been carried away they shall return
again, and possess the land of Jerusalem; wherefore, they shall be restored again to the land of their inheritance.
But, behold, they shall have wars, and rumors of wars; and when the day cometh that the Only Begotten of the Father, yea, even
the Father of heaven and of earth, shall manifest himself unto them in the flesh, behold, they will reject him, because of their
iniquities, and the hardness of their hearts, and the stiffness of their necks.
Behold, they will crucify him; and after he is laid in a sepulchre for the space of three days he shall rise from the dead, with
healing in his wings;  and all those who shall believe on his name shall be saved in the kingdom of God. Wherefore, my soul
delighteth to prophesy concerning him, for I have seen his day, and my heart doth magnify his holy name.
And behold it shall come to pass that after the Messiah hath risen from the dead, and hath manifested himself unto his people,
unto as many as will believe on his name, behold, Jerusalem shall be destroyed again; for wo unto them that fight against God and the
people of his church.
Wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered among all nations; yea, and also Babylon shall be destroyed; wherefore, the Jews shall be
scattered by other nations.
And after they have been scattered, and the Lord God hath scourged them by other nations for the space of many generations, yea,
even down from generation to generation until they shall be persuaded to believe in Christ, the Son of God, and the atonement, which
is infinite for all mankind--and when that day shall come that they shall believe in Christ, and worship the Father in his name, with
pure hearts and clean hands, and look not forward any more for another Messiah, then, at that time, the day will come that it must
needs be expedient that they should believe these things.
And the Lord will set his hand again the second time to restore his people  from their lost and fallen state. Wherefore, he will
proceed to do a marvelous work and a wonder  among the children of men.
Wherefore, he shall bring forth his words unto them, which words shall judge them at the last day, for they shall be given them for
the purpose of convincing them of the true Messiah, who was rejected by them; and unto the convincing of them that they need not
look forward any more for a Messiah to come, for there should not any come, save it should be a false Messiah which should deceive
the people; for there is save one Messiah spoken of by the prophets, and that Messiah is he who should be rejected of the Jews.
For according to the words of the prophets, the Messiah cometh in six hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem;
and according to the words of the prophets, and also the word of the angel of God, his name shall be Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
And now, my brethren, I have spoken plainly that ye cannot err. And as the Lord God liveth that brought Israel up out of the land
of Egypt, and gave unto Moses power that he should heal the nations after they had been bitten by the poisonous serpents, if they
would cast their eyes unto the serpent which he did raise up before them, and also gave him power that he should smite the rock and
the water should come forth; yea, behold I say unto you, that as these things are true, and as the Lord God liveth, there is none other
name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved.
Wherefore, for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me that these things which I write shall be kept and preserved, and
handed down unto my seed, from generation to generation, that the promise may be fulfilled unto Joseph, that his seed should never
perish as long as the earth should stand.
Wherefore, these things shall go from generation to generation as long as the earth shall stand; and they shall go according to the
will and pleasure of God; and the nations who shall possess them shall be judged of them according to the words which are written.
For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God;
for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.
And, notwithstanding we believe in Christ, we keep the law of Moses, and look forward with steadfastness unto Christ, until the
law shall be fulfilled.
For, for this end was the law given; wherefore the law hath become dead unto us, and we are made alive in Christ because of our
faith; yet we keep the law because of the commandments.
And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies,
that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.
Wherefore, we speak concerning the law that our children may know the deadness of the law; and they, by knowing the deadness
of the law, may look forward unto that life which is in Christ, and know for what end the law was given. And after the law is fulfilled
in Christ, that they need not harden their hearts against him when the law ought to be done away.
And now behold, my people, ye are a stiffnecked people; wherefore, I have spoken plainly unto you, that ye cannot
misunderstand. And the words which I have spoken shall stand as a testimony against you; for they are sufficient to teach any man the
right way; for the right way is to believe in Christ and deny him not; for by denying him ye also deny the prophets and the law.
And now behold, I say unto you that the right way is to believe in Christ, and deny him not; and Christ is the Holy One of Israel;
wherefore ye must bow down before him, and worship him with all your might, mind, and strength, and your whole soul; and if ye do
this ye shall in nowise be cast out.
And, inasmuch as it shall be expedient, ye must keep the performances and ordinances of God until the law shall be fulfilled
which was given unto Moses.


And after Christ shall have risen from the dead he shall show himself unto you, my children, and my beloved brethren; and the
words which he shall speak unto you shall be the law which ye shall do.
For behold, I say unto you that I have beheld that many generations shall pass away, and there shall be great wars and contentions
among my people.
And after the Messiah shall come there shall be signs given unto my people of his birth, and also of his death and resurrection; and
great and terrible shall that day be unto the wicked, for they shall perish; and they perish because they cast out the prophets, and the
saints, and stone them, and slay them; wherefore the cry of the blood of the saints shall ascend up to God from the ground against
them.


saith the Lord of Hosts,


saith the Lord of Hosts;


saith the Lord of Hosts.
O the pain, and the anguish of my soul for the loss of the slain of my people! For I, Nephi, have seen it, and it well nigh consumeth
me before the presence of the Lord; but I must cry unto my God: Thy ways are just.
But behold, the righteous that hearken unto the words of the prophets, and destroy them not, but look forward unto Christ with
steadfastness for the signs which are given, notwithstanding all persecution--behold, they are they which shall not perish.
But the Son of righteousness   shall appear unto them; and he shall heal them, and they shall have peace with him, until three
generations shall have passed away, and many of the fourth generation shall have passed away in righteousness.
And when these things have passed away a speedy destruction cometh unto my people; for, notwithstanding the pains of my soul,
I have seen it; wherefore, I know that it shall come to pass; and they sell themselves for naught; for, for the reward of their pride and
their foolishness they shall reap destruction; for because they yield unto the devil and choose works of darkness rather than light,
therefore they must go down to hell.
For the Spirit of the Lord will not always strive with man. And when the Spirit ceaseth to strive with man then cometh speedy
destruction, and this grieveth my soul.
And as I spake concerning the convincing of the Jews, that Jesus is the very Christ, it must needs be that the Gentiles be
convinced also that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God;
And that he manifesteth himself unto all those who believe in him, by the power of the Holy Ghost; yea, unto every nation,
kindred, tongue, and people, working mighty miracles, signs, and wonders, among the children of men according to their faith.
But behold, I prophesy unto you concerning the last days; concerning the days when the Lord God shall bring these things forth
unto the children of men.
After my seed and the seed of my brethren shall have dwindled in unbelief, and shall have been smitten by the Gentiles; yea, after
the Lord God shall have camped against them round about, and shall have laid siege against them with a mount, and raised forts
against them; and after they shall have been brought down low in the dust, even that they are not, yet the words of the righteous shall
be written, and the prayers of the faithful shall be heard, and all those who have dwindled in unbelief shall not be forgotten.
For those who shall be destroyed shall speak unto them out of the ground, and their speech shall be low out of the dust, and their
voice shall be as one that hath a familiar spirit; for the Lord God will give unto him power, that he may whisper concerning them,
even as it were out of the ground; and their speech shall whisper out of the dust.
For thus saith the Lord God:


Wherefore, as those who have been destroyed have been destroyed speedily; and the multitude of their terrible ones shall be as
chaff that passeth away?


thus saith the Lord God:


And it shall come to pass, that those who have dwindled in unbelief shall be smitten by the hand of the Gentiles.
And the Gentiles are lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and have stumbled, because of the greatness of their stumbling block, that
they have built up many churches; nevertheless, they put down the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto themselves their
own wisdom and their own learning, that they may get gain and grind upon the face of the poor.
And there are many churches built up which cause envyings, and strifes, and malice.
And there are also secret combinations, even as in times of old, according to the combinations of the devil, for he is the founder of
all these things; yea, the founder of murder, and works of darkness; yea, and he leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he
bindeth them with his strong cords forever.
For behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you that the Lord God worketh not in darkness.
He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he
may draw all men unto him. Wherefore, he commandeth none that they shall not partake of his salvation.
Behold, doth he cry unto any, saying: Depart from me?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but he saith:


Behold, hath he commanded any that they should depart out of the synagogues, or out of the houses of worship?
Behold, I say unto you, Nay.
Hath he commanded any that they should not partake of his salvation? Behold I say unto you, Nay; but he hath given it free for all
men; and he hath commanded his people that they should persuade all men to repentance.
Behold, hath the Lord commanded any that they should not partake of his goodness? Behold I say unto you, Nay; but all men are
privileged the one like unto the other, and none are forbidden.
He commandeth that there shall be no priestcrafts; for, behold, priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light
unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion.
Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore, the Lord God hath given a commandment that all men should have charity,
which charity is love. And except they should have charity they were nothing. Wherefore, if they should have charity they would not
suffer the laborer in Zion to perish.
But the laborer in Zion shall labor for Zion; for if they labor for money they shall perish.
And again, the Lord God hath commanded that men should not murder; that they should not lie; that they should not steal; that
they should not take the name of the Lord their God in vain; that they should not envy; that they should not have malice; that they
should not contend one with another; that they should not commit whoredoms; and that they should do none of these things; for whoso
doeth them shall perish.
For none of these iniquities come of the Lord; for he doeth that which is good among the children of men; and he doeth nothing
save it be plain unto the children of men; and he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none
that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God,
both Jew and Gentile.


But, behold, in the last days, or in the days of the Gentiles--yea, behold all the nations of the Gentiles and also the Jews, both those
who shall come upon this land and those who shall be upon other lands, yea, even upon all the lands of the earth, behold, they will be
drunken with iniquity and all manner of abominations--
And when that day shall come they shall be visited of the Lord of Hosts, with thunder and with earthquake, and with a great noise,
and with storm, and with tempest, and with the flame of devouring fire.
And all the nations that fight against Zion, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it shall be unto them,
even as unto a hungry man which dreameth, and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man
which dreameth, and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so shall the
multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion.
For behold, all ye that doeth iniquity, stay yourselves and wonder, for ye shall cry out, and cry; yea, ye shall be drunken but not
with wine, ye shall stagger but not with strong drink.
For behold, the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep. For behold, ye have closed your eyes, and ye have rejected
the prophets; and your rulers, and the seers hath he covered because of your iniquity.
And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall bring forth unto you the words of a book,  and they shall be the words of them
which have slumbered.
And behold the book shall be sealed; and in the book shall be a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending
thereof.
Wherefore, because of the things which are sealed up, the things which are sealed shall not be delivered in the day of the
wickedness and abominations of the people. Wherefore the book shall be kept from them.
But the book shall be delivered unto a man, and he shall deliver the words of the book, which are the words of those who have
slumbered in the dust, and he shall deliver these words unto another;
But the words which are sealed he shall not deliver, neither shall he deliver the book. For the book shall be sealed by the power of
God, and the revelation which was sealed shall be kept in the book until the own due time of the Lord, that they may come forth; for
behold, they reveal all things from the foundation of the world unto the end thereof.
And the day cometh that the words of the book which were sealed shall be read upon the house tops; and they shall be read by the
power of Christ; and all things shall be revealed unto the children of men which ever have been among the children of men, and which
ever will be even unto the end of the earth.
Wherefore, at that day when the book shall be delivered unto the man of whom I have spoken, the book shall be hid from the eyes
of the world, that the eyes of none shall behold it save it be that three witnesses shall behold it, by the power of God, besides him to
whom the book shall be delivered; and they shall testify to the truth of the book and the things therein.
And there is none other which shall view it, save it be a few according to the will of God, to bear testimony of his word unto the
children of men; for the Lord God hath said that the words of the faithful should speak as if it were from the dead.
Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to bring forth the words of the book; and in the mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth
him good will he establish his word; and wo be unto him that rejecteth the word of God!
But behold, it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall say unto him to whom he shall deliver the book:


And the learned shall say:


And now, because of the glory of the world and to get gain will they say this, and not for the glory of God.
And the man shall say:


Then shall the learned say:


Wherefore it shall come to pass, that the Lord God will deliver again the book and the words thereof to him that is not learned;
and the man that is not learned shall say:


Then shall the Lord God say unto him:

And now, behold, my brethren, I have spoken unto you, according as the Spirit hath constrained me; wherefore, I know that they
must surely come to pass.
And the things which shall be written out of the book shall be of great worth unto the children of men, and especially unto our seed,
which is a remnant of the house of Israel.
For it shall come to pass in that day that the churches which are built up, and not unto the Lord, when the one shall say unto the
other: Behold, I, I am the Lord's;  and the others shall say: I, I am the Lord's; and thus shall every one say that hath built up
churches, and not unto the Lord?
And they shall contend one with another; and their priests shall contend one with another, and they shall teach with their learning,
and deny the Holy Ghost, which giveth utterance.
And they deny the power of God, the Holy One of Israel; and they say unto the people: Hearken unto us, and hear ye our precept;
for behold there is no God today, for the Lord and the Redeemer hath done his work, and he hath given his power unto men;
Behold, hearken ye unto my precept; if they shall say there is a miracle wrought by the hand of the Lord, believe it not; for this day
he is not a God of miracles; he hath done his work.
Yea, and there shall be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die;  and it shall be well with us.
And there shall also be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God--he will justify in committing a
little sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in this; and do all
these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in
the kingdom of God.
Yea, and there shall be many which shall teach after this manner, false and vain and foolish doctrines, and shall be puffed up in
their hearts, and shall seek deep to hide their counsels from the Lord; and their works shall be in the dark.
And the blood of the saints shall cry from the ground against them.
Yea, they have all gone out of the way; they have become corrupted.
Because of pride, and because of false teachers, and false doctrine, their churches have become corrupted, and their churches are
lifted up; because of pride they are puffed up.
They rob the poor because of their fine sanctuaries; they rob the poor because of their fine clothing; and they persecute the meek
and the poor in heart, because in their pride they are puffed up.
They wear stiff necks and high heads; yea, and because of pride, and wickedness, and abominations, and whoredoms, they have
all gone astray  save it be a few, who are the humble followers of Christ; nevertheless, they are led, that in many instances they do
err because they are taught by the precepts of men.
O the wise, and the learned, and the rich, that are puffed up in the pride of their hearts, and all those who preach false doctrines,
and all those who commit whoredoms, and pervert the right way of the Lord,


saith the Lord God Almighty,


Wo unto them that turn aside the just for a thing of naught  and revile against that which is good, and say that it is of no worth!
For the day shall come that the Lord God will speedily visit the inhabitants of the earth; and in that day that they are fully ripe in
iniquity they shall perish.
But


saith the Lord of Hosts.
But behold, that great and abominable church, the whore of all the earth, must tumble to the earth, and great must be the fall
thereof.
For the kingdom of the devil must shake, and they which belong to it must needs be stirred up unto repentance, or the devil will
grasp them with his everlasting chains, and they be stirred up to anger, and perish;
For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.
And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all
is well--and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.
And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto them:


and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance.
Yea, they are grasped with death, and hell; and death, and hell, and the devil, and all that have been seized therewith must stand
before the throne of God, and be judged according to their works, from whence they must go into the place prepared for them, even a
lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment.
Therefore, wo be unto him that is at ease in Zion!
Wo be unto him that crieth: All is well!
Yea, wo be unto him that hearkeneth unto the precepts of men,  and denieth the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost!
Yea, wo be unto him that saith: We have received, and we need no more!
And in fine, wo unto all those who tremble, and are angry because of the truth of God! For behold, he that is built upon the rock
receiveth it with gladness; and he that is built upon a sandy foundation trembleth lest he shall fall.
Wo be unto him that shall say: We have received the word of God, and we need no more of the word of God, for we have enough!
For behold, thus saith the Lord God:


saith the Lord God of Hosts!


saith the Lord God,


saith the Lord God of Hosts.


But thus saith the Lord God:


And now behold, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you; for I, Nephi, would not suffer that ye should suppose that ye are
more righteous than the Gentiles shall be. For behold, except ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall all likewise perish; and
because of the words which have been spoken ye need not suppose that the Gentiles are utterly destroyed.
For behold, I say unto you that as many of the Gentiles as will repent are the covenant people of the Lord; and as many of the Jews
as will not repent shall be cast off; for the Lord covenanteth with none save it be with them that repent and believe in his Son, who is
the Holy One of Israel.
And now, I would prophesy somewhat more concerning the Jews and the Gentiles. For after the book of which I have spoken shall
come forth, and be written unto the Gentiles, and sealed up again unto the Lord, there shall be many which shall believe the words
which are written; and they shall carry them forth unto the remnant of our seed.
And then shall the remnant of our seed know concerning us, how that we came out from Jerusalem, and that they are descendants
of the Jews.
And the gospel of Jesus Christ shall be declared among them; wherefore, they shall be restored unto the knowledge of their fathers,
and also to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, which was had among their fathers.
And then shall they rejoice; for they shall know that it is a blessing unto them from the hand of God; and their scales of darkness
shall begin to fall from their eyes; and many generations shall not pass away among them, save they shall be a pure and a delightsome
people.
And it shall come to pass that the Jews which are scattered also shall begin to believe in Christ; and they shall begin to gather in
upon the face of the land; and as many as shall believe in Christ shall also become a delightsome people.
And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall commence his work among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, to bring
about the restoration of his people upon the earth.
And with righteousness shall the Lord God judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth. And he shall smite
the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.
For the time speedily cometh that the Lord God shall cause a great division among the people, and the wicked will he destroy; and
he will spare his people, yea, even if it so be that he must destroy the wicked by fire.
And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.
And then shall the wolf dwell with the lamb; and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf, and the young lion, and the
fatling, together; and a little child shall lead them.
And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice's den.
They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters
cover the sea.
Wherefore, the things of all nations shall be made known; yea, all things shall be made known unto the children of men.
There is nothing which is secret save it shall be revealed; there is no work of darkness save it shall be made manifest in the light;
and there is nothing which is sealed upon the earth save it shall be loosed.
Wherefore, all things which have been revealed unto the children of men shall at that day be revealed; and Satan shall have power
over the hearts of the children of men no more, for a long time. And now, my beloved brethren, I make an end of my sayings.


And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my beloved brethren. And I cannot write but a few things, which I
know must surely come to pass; neither can I write but a few of the words of my brother Jacob.
Wherefore, the things which I have written sufficeth me, save it be a few words which I must speak concerning the doctrine of
Christ; wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to the plainness of my prophesying.
For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men. For the Lord God
giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their language, unto their understanding.
Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that I have spoken unto you concerning that prophet which the Lord showed unto me,
that should baptize the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world.
And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how
much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!
And now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb of God did fulfil all righteousness in being baptized by
water?
Know ye not that he was holy? But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh
he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his
commandments.
Wherefore, after he was baptized with water the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove.
And again, it showeth unto the children of men the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should
enter, he having set the example before them.
And he said unto the children of men:


Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?
And the Father said:


And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying:


Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no
deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the
name of Christ, by baptism--yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then
shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongue of
angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.
But, behold, my beloved brethren, thus came the voice of the Son unto me, saying:


And I heard a voice from the Father, saying:


And now, my beloved brethren, I know by this that unless a man shall endure to the end, in following the example of the Son of
the living God, he cannot be saved.
Wherefore, do the things which I have told you I have seen that your Lord and your Redeemer should do; for, for this cause have
they been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by which ye should enter. For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance
and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.
And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done
according to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye have received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the Father and
the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made, that if ye entered in by the way ye should receive.
And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto
you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits
of him who is mighty to save.
Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all
men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father:


And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man
can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end. Amen.


And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I suppose that ye ponder somewhat in your hearts concerning that which ye should do after
ye have entered in by the way. But, behold, why do ye ponder these things in your hearts?
Do ye not remember that I said unto you that after ye had received the Holy Ghost ye could speak with the tongue of angels? And
now, how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?
Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ. Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon
the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.
Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock;
wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must perish in the dark.
For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things
what ye should do.
Behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and there will be no more doctrine given until after he shall manifest himself unto you in the
flesh. And when he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh, the things which he shall say unto you shall ye observe to do.
And now I, Nephi, cannot say more; the Spirit stoppeth mine utterance, and I am left to mourn because of the unbelief, and the
wickedness, and the ignorance, and the stiffneckedness of men; for they will not search knowledge, nor understand great knowledge,
when it is given unto them in plainness, even as plain as word can be.
And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this
thing. For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit
teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.
But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the
first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance
may be for the welfare of thy soul.


And now I, Nephi, cannot write all the things which were taught among my people; neither am I mighty in writing, like unto
speaking; for when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the
children of men.
But behold, there are many that harden their hearts against the Holy Spirit, that it hath no place in them; wherefore, they cast many
things away which are written and esteem them as things of naught.
But I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem it as of great worth, and especially unto my people. For I pray
continually for them by day, and mine eyes water my pillow by night, because of them; and I cry unto my God in faith, and I know
that he will hear my cry.
And I know that the Lord God will consecrate my prayers for the gain of my people. And the words which I have written in
weakness will be made strong unto them; for it persuadeth them to do good; it maketh known unto them of their fathers; and it
speaketh of Jesus, and persuadeth them to believe in him, and to endure to the end, which is life eternal.
And it speaketh harshly against sin, according to the plainness of the truth; wherefore, no man will be angry at the words which I
have written save he shall be of the spirit of the devil.
I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul from hell.
I have charity for my people, and great faith in Christ that I shall meet many souls spotless at his judgment-seat.
I have charity for the Jew--I say Jew, because I mean them from whence I came.
I also have charity for the Gentiles. But behold, for none of these can I hope except they shall be reconciled unto Christ, and enter
into the narrow gate, and walk in the strait path which leads to life, and continue in the path until the end of the day of probation.
And now, my beloved brethren, and also Jew, and all ye ends of the earth, hearken unto these words and believe in Christ; and if
ye believe not in these words believe in Christ. And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words
of Christ, and he hath given them unto me; and they teach all men that they should do good.
And if they are not the words of Christ, judge ye--for Christ will show unto you, with power and great glory, that they are his
words, at the last day; and you and I shall stand face to face before his bar; and ye shall know that I have been commanded of him to
write these things, notwithstanding my weakness.
And I pray the Father in the name of Christ that many of us, if not all, may be saved in his kingdom at that great and last day.
And now, my beloved brethren, all those who are of the house of Israel, and all ye ends of the earth, I speak unto you as the voice
of one crying from the dust: Farewell until that great day shall come.
And you that will not partake of the goodness of God, and respect the words of the Jews, and also my words, and the words which
shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the Lamb of God, behold, I bid you an everlasting farewell, for these words shall condemn you
at the last day.
For what I seal on earth, shall be brought against you at the judgment bar; for thus hath the Lord commanded me, and I must
obey. Amen.

After what ye have seen, will ye preach again unto this people, that they shall be cast into a lake of fire and brimstone? Behold, ye see that ye had not power to save those who had been cast into the fire; neither has God saved them because they were of thy faith.

What say ye for yourselves?

Why do ye not answer the words of this people? Know ye not that I have power to deliver you up unto the flames?

If ye have the power of God deliver yourselves from these bands, and then we will believe that the Lord will destroy this people according to your words.

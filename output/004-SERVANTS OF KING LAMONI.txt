Now the king will slay us, as he has our brethren because their flocks were scattered by the wickedness of these men.

Behold, our flocks are scattered already.

Whether he be the Great Spirit or a man, we know not; but this much we do know, that he cannot be slain by the enemies of the king; neither can they scatter the king's flocks when he is with us, because of his expertness and great strength; therefore, we know that he is a friend to the king. And now, O king, we do not believe that a man has such great power, for we know he cannot be slain.

Behold, he is feeding thy horses.

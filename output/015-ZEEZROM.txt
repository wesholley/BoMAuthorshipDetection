Will ye answer the questions which I shall put unto you?

Behold, here are six onties of silver, and all these will I give thee if thou wilt deny the existence of a Supreme Being.

Behold these six onties, which are of great worth, I will give unto thee?

Thou sayest there is a true and living God?

Is there more than one God?

How knowest thou these things?

Who is he that shall come? Is it the Son of God?

Shall he save his people in their sins?

Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?

What does this mean which Amulek hath spoken concerning the resurrection of the dead, that all shall rise from the dead, both the just and the unjust, and are brought to stand before God to be judged according to their works?

Behold, I am guilty, and these men are spotless before God.

Yea, I believe all the words that thou hast taught.

Yea, I believe according to thy words.

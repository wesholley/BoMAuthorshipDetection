The servants of my husband have made it known unto me that thou art a prophet of a holy God, and that thou hast power to do many mighty works in his name; Therefore, if this is the case, I would that ye should go in and see my husband, for he has been laid upon his bed for the space of two days and two nights; and some say that he is not dead, but others say that he is dead and that he stinketh, and that he ought to be placed in the sepulchre; but as for myself, to me he doth not stink.

I have had no witness save thy word, and the word of our servants; nevertheless I believe that it shall be according as thou hast said.

O blessed Jesus, who has saved me from an awful hell! O blessed God, have mercy on this people!
